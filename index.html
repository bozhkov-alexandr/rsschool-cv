         <h3>Brief information about myself</h3>
         <p>
            I live in Minsk, Belarus. In 2019 I have graduated from Belarus State Economic University.
             Talking about strengths, I would like to mention that I am diligent,
             observant and stress-resistant  person.In 2020 i worked as a customer service specialist in VFS GLObal.
              Now i am a self entrepreneur. In this year i try myself at QA courses in EPAM,
              but soon i realized that QA - was not my cup of tea. Thats why i want to obtain a position as a js junior developer in EPAM company.

         <h3>Skills</h3>
         <p>I’m learning at sources like Metanit and Youtube. I’ve already learned:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>
                 the basics of html/css, js and git
             </li>
             <li>
                 take some basic knowladge about Linux
             </li> 
             <li>
                 my english level is A2
             </li>   

         </ul>
         <p>
            But I still need to concrete and sort my knowledge about all of this.
             I’m looking forward to starting full-time job in the IT-sphere, for me, it’s a new challenge in life and an
              opportunity to expand and apply my skills and potential.
               And it will motivate me more, than just trying to learn on my own.
